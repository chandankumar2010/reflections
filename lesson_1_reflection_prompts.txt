How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?
=> By usinf diff tool we can locate where changes has been made.
And thus it reduces the effort to locate the bug and fix it.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?
=> Viewing entire history enables us to track when particular change has been made.
Track changes made by other or me and analyse why that particular change has been made.
It will enable us to roll back to previous version in event of an issue or a bug.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
=>Manual commits gives us the full control when to push the changes to the main source.
By using manual method we can push multiple edits in one go and thus we can have like a checkpoint for multiple edits made.
Manual commits means fewer changes to track and thus less timeline to deal with.

Cons: We can lose edits in case of system failure.
Fewer checkpoints to roll back.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
